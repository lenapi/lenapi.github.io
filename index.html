        We propose a theory of subtle discrimination, defined as bias-driven discriminatory behavior without direct payoff consequences. We develop a model in which candidates compete for promotion to a better job. The principal is biased towards candidates from a particular group. When choosing among equally-qualified candidates, the principal subtly discriminates by breaking ties in a biased manner. Subtle discrimination matters because it distorts candidates’ decisions to invest in human capital. The model generates several predictions: (i) discriminated agents perform better in low-stakes careers, (ii) human-capital-intensive firms offering high-stakes careers are more likely to become “progressive” or “activist,” (iii) market forces do not eliminate subtle discrimination, and (iv) standard tests for discrimination have no power against subtle discrimination.

    Using stock holdings data for local investment advisers that cater to individual clients, we compare the portfolio composition between different counties across the U.S. and relate it to the political differences between these counties. While political differences between counties have been increasing over the last 25 years, they seem to have little effect on differences in portfolio composition in the early part of our sample. However, since 2013 political differences exhibit a large and significant effect on differences in portfolio composition. Using the entry of a major conservative media network as a shock to county-level political views, we show that at least some of this effect likely represents a causal impact of political divisions on portfolio differences. Finally, we show that the effect of political division on differences in households’ equity portfolio choices operates through diverging political views on social and environmental issues rather than through differences in economic expectations. Our study suggests that increasing political divisions could lead to diverging household portfolios across the U.S. as investors increasingly align their financial investment with their politically shaped values.

            <p> A recent literature points to individuals having preferences for autonomy from others when it concerns how much they earn. Using a simple experiment we evaluate whether individuals exhibit preferences for autonomy without confounds present in the earlier work. We show that in their vast majority (close to 90%), individuals show no such preferences for autonomy. Our results suggest that the previously documented prevalence of autonomy preferences is likely due to risk attitudes, environment complexity, perceived uncertainty or beliefs, rather than preferences for autonomy in pay <i>per se</i>. </p>

           <p> I study the impact of contractual incentives on the behavior of mutual fund managers in annual tournaments. I show that linear contracts as opposed to concave ones induce managers to make larger risk adjustments in response to their relative performance ranks. I argue that contracts with linear fee structure directly translate the convex relationship between past fund returns and fund size into a convex relationship between past performance and managerial pay, whereas concave contracts distort this relationship and make it less convex. I also demonstrate that higher fee rates encourage fund managers to engage into annual tournaments, as they strengthen the connection between fund size and managerial pay in comparison with lower fee rates. The above results are robust to controlling for funds characteristics, such as fund size, age and turnover, as well as year- and style-fixed effects. </p>

            <p> We compare the risk preferences of Chinese students in the Netherlands with those of Dutch students in the Netherlands using three different measures for risk attitudes: self-reports, a lottery-choice task, and trading behavior in an experimental stock market. While Chinese subjects self-report to be more risk-seeking than Dutch, their claims are not supported by their decisions in the incentive-compatible lottery-choice task and their trading behavior in our experimental stock market. We discuss potential explanations for our findings, including foreign-language effects, sample selection, and the "cushion" hypothesis. </p>
