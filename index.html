            <p> Power relations are ubiquitous. While having power and being able to determine the outcomes of others is usually associated with benefits, such as higher compensation or public recognition, we demonstrate that a substantial fraction of individuals seek power even in the absence of such benefits. Such individuals are willing to accept a lower payoff for themselves in exchange for power over others. We show that preferences for power exist in the absence of other components of decision rights, and that they are different than, and cannot be explained by, social preferences. We establish that ignoring such intrinsic preferences for power has large welfare consequences. </p>

            <p> Predicting workerâ€™s effort is important in many different areas, but is often difficult. Using a laboratory experiment, we test the hypothesis that confidence, i.e. person-specific beliefs about her abilities, can be used as a generic proxy to predict effort provision. We measure confidence in the domain of financial knowledge in three different ways (self-assessed knowledge, probability-based confidence, and incentive-compatible confidence) and find a positive relation with the actual provision of effort in an unrelated domain. Additional analysis shows that the findings are independent of personal traits such as gender, age, and nationality. </p>

           <p> I study the impact of contractual incentives on the behavior of mutual fund managers in annual tournaments. I show that linear contracts as opposed to concave ones induce managers to make larger risk adjustments in response to their relative performance ranks. I argue that contracts with linear fee structure directly translate the convex relationship between past fund returns and fund size into a convex relationship between past performance and managerial pay, whereas concave contracts distort this relationship and make it less convex. I also demonstrate that higher fee rates encourage fund managers to engage into annual tournaments, as they strengthen the connection between fund size and managerial pay in comparison with lower fee rates. The above results are robust to controlling for funds characteristics, such as fund size, age and turnover, as well as year- and style-fixed effects. </p>

            <p> We compare the risk preferences of Chinese students in the Netherlands with those of Dutch students in the Netherlands using three different measures for risk attitudes: self-reports, a lottery-choice task, and trading behavior in an experimental stock market. While Chinese subjects self-report to be more risk-seeking than Dutch, their claims are not supported by their decisions in the incentive-compatible lottery-choice task and their trading behavior in our experimental stock market. We discuss potential explanations for our findings, including foreign-language effects, sample selection, and the "cushion" hypothesis. </p>
