            We propose a theory of <i>subtle</i> discrimination, defined as biased acts that cannot be objectively ascertained as discriminatory. We present a model in which candidates compete for a promotion. When choosing among equally qualified candidates, the principal subtly discriminates by breaking ties in favor of candidates from a particular group. Subtle discrimination matters because it affects decisions to invest in human capital. The model predicts that discriminated agents perform better in low-stakes careers while favored agents perform better in high-stakes careers. In equilibrium, firms are polarized: high-productivity firms strive to be “progressive” and have diverse top management teams, while low-productivity firms prefer to be “conservative” and have little diversity at the top.

    We examine the differences in the stock holdings of wealthy households in different counties of the U.S. with different political preferences over the past 25 years. Although political differences between counties have been increasing since at least 1996, it is not until 2013 when they started to increasingly and significantly contribute to differences in equity portfolio composition. Using the entry of a major conservative media network as a shock to county-level political preferences, we find evidence for a causal effect of political differences. We show that the effect of political differences on portfolio differences operates mainly through diverging political views on social and environmental issues rather than differences in economic expectations. Our study suggests that political polarization could reduce risk sharing and segment U.S. equity markets by political lines and – given the partisan segregation – geographical lines.

            <p> A recent literature points to individuals having preferences for autonomy from others when it concerns how much they earn. Using a simple experiment we evaluate whether individuals exhibit preferences for autonomy without confounds present in the earlier work. We show that in their vast majority (close to 90%), individuals show no such preferences for autonomy. Our results suggest that the previously documented prevalence of autonomy preferences is likely due to risk attitudes, environment complexity, perceived uncertainty or beliefs, rather than preferences for autonomy in pay <i>per se</i>. </p>

           <p> I study the impact of contractual incentives on the behavior of mutual fund managers in annual tournaments. I show that linear contracts as opposed to concave ones induce managers to make larger risk adjustments in response to their relative performance ranks. I argue that contracts with linear fee structure directly translate the convex relationship between past fund returns and fund size into a convex relationship between past performance and managerial pay, whereas concave contracts distort this relationship and make it less convex. I also demonstrate that higher fee rates encourage fund managers to engage into annual tournaments, as they strengthen the connection between fund size and managerial pay in comparison with lower fee rates. The above results are robust to controlling for funds characteristics, such as fund size, age and turnover, as well as year- and style-fixed effects. </p>

            <p> We compare the risk preferences of Chinese students in the Netherlands with those of Dutch students in the Netherlands using three different measures for risk attitudes: self-reports, a lottery-choice task, and trading behavior in an experimental stock market. While Chinese subjects self-report to be more risk-seeking than Dutch, their claims are not supported by their decisions in the incentive-compatible lottery-choice task and their trading behavior in our experimental stock market. We discuss potential explanations for our findings, including foreign-language effects, sample selection, and the "cushion" hypothesis. </p>
