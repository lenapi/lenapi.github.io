</a>, with Yihui Pan, Stephan Siegel, and Tracy Yue Wang. Current version: January 2020. First draft: August 2019.

            <p> Starting in 2018, U.S. public companies are required to disclose the ratio of CEO to median worker pay, providing the first opportunity to examine equity markets’ reaction to within-firm pay dispersion. We find a negative market reaction to firms disclosing high pay ratios. Additional evidence suggests that equity markets “dislike” high pay dispersion independently of high CEO pay or low worker pay. In the cross-section, firms whose shareholders have stronger prosocial preferences experience a significantly more negative market response to high pay ratios. Consistent with investors’ prosocial preferences moderating the initial market reaction, we find that during 2018 investors with stronger prosocial preferences rebalance their portfolios away from high pay ratio stocks relative to other investors. Overall, our results suggest that investors’ prosocial preferences, in particular with respect to within-firm pay dispersion, is a channel through which high pay ratios negatively affect firm value. </p>

            <p> A recent literature points to individuals having preferences for autonomy from others when it concerns how much they earn. Using a simple experiment we evaluate whether individuals exhibit preferences for autonomy without confounds present in the earlier work. We show that in their vast majority (close to 90%), individuals show no such preferences for autonomy. Our results suggest that the previously documented prevalence of autonomy preferences is likely due to risk attitudes, environment complexity, perceived uncertainty or beliefs, rather than preferences for autonomy in pay <i>per se</i>. </p>

            <p> Power—the ability to determine the outcomes of others—usually comes with various benefits: higher compensation, public recognition, etc. We develop a new game, the Power Game, and use it to demonstrate that a substantial fraction of individuals enjoy the intrinsic value of power: they accept a lower payoff in exchange for power over others, without any additional benefits to themselves. We show that preferences for power exist independently of other  components of decision rights. Further, these preferences cannot be explained by social preferences and are not driven by mistakes, confusion or signaling intentions. Using a series of additional experiments, we show that valuation of power (i) is higher when individuals directly determine outcomes of others as opposed to simply influence them; (ii) depends on how much discretion they have over those outcomes; (iii) is tied to relationships between individuals; and (iv) likely depends on the domain: value of power is salient in work-place settings but not necessarily in others. We establish that ignoring preferences for power may have large welfare implications. Consequently, our findings provide strong reasons for incorporating preferences for power in the study of political systems, labor contracts and work relationships.</p>

           <p> I study the impact of contractual incentives on the behavior of mutual fund managers in annual tournaments. I show that linear contracts as opposed to concave ones induce managers to make larger risk adjustments in response to their relative performance ranks. I argue that contracts with linear fee structure directly translate the convex relationship between past fund returns and fund size into a convex relationship between past performance and managerial pay, whereas concave contracts distort this relationship and make it less convex. I also demonstrate that higher fee rates encourage fund managers to engage into annual tournaments, as they strengthen the connection between fund size and managerial pay in comparison with lower fee rates. The above results are robust to controlling for funds characteristics, such as fund size, age and turnover, as well as year- and style-fixed effects. </p>

            <p> We compare the risk preferences of Chinese students in the Netherlands with those of Dutch students in the Netherlands using three different measures for risk attitudes: self-reports, a lottery-choice task, and trading behavior in an experimental stock market. While Chinese subjects self-report to be more risk-seeking than Dutch, their claims are not supported by their decisions in the incentive-compatible lottery-choice task and their trading behavior in our experimental stock market. We discuss potential explanations for our findings, including foreign-language effects, sample selection, and the "cushion" hypothesis. </p>
